;; Amicable Numbers
;;
;; Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less 
;; than n which divide evenly into n).
;; If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable 
;; pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
;;
;; For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 
;; 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 
;; 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
;;
;; Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.


;; The Plan
;;
;; - write factor function, and then a sum of factors function
;; - map that function across (range 1 10001)
;; - use that to write a "amicable" function that checks if a number is part of
;;   an amicable pair
;; - then sum those pairs
